## 🖼️ How It Works

### Upload
- Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`
- Drag and drop one or more photos onto the upload zone, or click to browse
- Each photo appears as a card with a thumbnail

### Crop (Optional but Recommended)
- Click **Crop** on any photo card
- A modal cropper opens with a fixed passport aspect ratio (384×472)
- Adjust the crop area and click **Crop & Save**

### Set Copies
- Each photo card has a **Copies** input (default: 6)
- Change it per photo to control how many times it appears on the sheet

### Advanced Options (Optional)
- Click **Advanced Options** to customize:
  - **Width / Height** — passport photo dimensions in pixels
  - **Spacing** — gap between rows of photos
  - **Border** — black border thickness around each photo

### Generate
- Click **Generate Sheet**
- The backend processes each photo:
  1. Removes the background via remove.bg
  2. Uploads to Cloudinary and applies AI restoration
  3. Resizes and adds a border
- All photos are arranged on A4 pages (2480×3508 px at 300 DPI)
- If photos overflow one page, new pages are added automatically

### Download
- Once generated, a PDF preview appears in the browser
- Click **Download PDF** to save the print-ready file
